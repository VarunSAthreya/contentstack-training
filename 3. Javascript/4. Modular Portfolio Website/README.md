# [Rendering Personal Portfolio website.](https://varunsathreya.github.io/contentstack-training/3.%20Javascript/4.%20Modular%20Portfolio%20Website/index.html)

Till now you have understood how to work with functions, arrays, string. Over the past week we learnt how to modularize your JavaScript code.

This can be done by splitting code over multiple files and using JavaScript modules to share functionalities across different files.

In this task you will work on separating the code from content of your personal portfolio website. The data for website will be stored in form of `.json` files.

These will include data for different components like `Headers`, `Footers`, `Banner` etc.

1. Model different components and store data needed for that component into a `.json` file
2. The website will be broken down into reusable components.
    - E.g Header can be broken down into `Logo` and `Navigation_Links`
3. Each component has to be created as a JavaScript class or function constructor.
4. The main app file will import these different components and render to create your entire webpage.

The look and feel of the website should be similar to the one created using plain HTML/CSS.

In case you have multiple pages in your website, pick a page that allows you to have more components.
